## Done

- [x] Fix App Store TestFlight provisioning warning.

- [x] Add automatic minor version bumps after merges to `main`.
  Completion criteria: a workflow runs on non-bot pushes to `main`, increments
  `MARKETING_VERSION` by one minor version, increments
  `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`, and commits the bump without looping.

- [x] Check remote branch hygiene.
  Completion criteria: stale remote-tracking refs are pruned and only active
  unmerged work remains outside `main`.

  Completion criteria: homepage includes jurisdiction-neutral legal nuance, a
  not-legal-advice caveat, source links, and free/open recorder recommendations
  including Notely Voice from F-Droid.

- [x] Add static website source under `ops/site`.
  Completion criteria: homepage, support, privacy, feedback, CSS, and screenshot
  asset exist locally.

  Completion criteria: `apple/Setapp-Info.plist` contains Setapp bundle
  metadata and `NSUpdateSecurityPolicy`.

- [x] Add Setapp final zip packaging structure.
  Completion criteria: release script puts `Distavo.app` and `AppIcon.png` in
  the Setapp upload zip.

- [x] Validate Setapp repo-side packaging.
  Completion criteria: Setapp Info.plist lints, unsigned Setapp build succeeds,
  and built app Info.plist contains the Setapp bundle ID, version, icon key, and
  `NSUpdateSecurityPolicy`.

- [x] Deploy `ops/site` to `distavo.com`.
  Completion criteria: live `/`, `/privacy/`, `/support/`, `/feedback/`, CSS,
