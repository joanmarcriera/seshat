Distavo is designed so that your recordings and notes stay on machines you
control. This document describes exactly what data Distavo produces, where it is
stored, and what (if anything) leaves your Mac.

## What data Distavo produces

For each recording it processes, Distavo creates:

- **A WAV copy** of the recording, produced locally by AVFoundation from your
  original file.
- **A transcript** of the audio, returned by your WhisperX server.
- **A summary / structured note**, produced by your Ollama model from the
  transcript.
- The original recording file is left where you placed it.

## Where data is stored locally

- **Recordings** you drop in: the watched folder, by default
  `~/Documents/Distavo/recordings`.
- **Notes** (the final Markdown): by default
  `~/Documents/Distavo/notes/<name>.md`.
- **Working/cache files** (including intermediate WAVs and transcripts) and the
  app's configuration (`watcher-config.json`): under
  `~/Library/Application Support/Distavo/`.
- **Logs**: `~/Library/Logs/Distavo/distavo.log`.

All of these are written in **cleartext** under your home directory. Distavo
does not encrypt them; protect them with your normal macOS account and disk
encryption (FileVault).

## What leaves your machine, and where it goes

Distavo talks to exactly two network endpoints, both of which **you** configure:

1. **Your WhisperX server** — the locally converted WAV is uploaded here for
   transcription.
2. **Your Ollama server** — the cleaned transcript is sent here for
   summarisation, and the model's response comes back.

These endpoints can be on `localhost`, on your own network, or remote. Because
the audio and transcript leave your Mac to reach them, **only configure servers
you operate or fully trust.** If you want everything to stay on your own Mac,
run WhisperX and Ollama locally and point Distavo at `127.0.0.1`.

## No telemetry

Distavo has **no telemetry and no phone-home**. It does not collect analytics,
crash reports, usage statistics, or any other data, and it does not contact any
server other than the WhisperX and Ollama URLs you set. Settings are a native
window in the app — there is no embedded web server or open network port.

## Recommendation

Prefer **local or otherwise trusted** WhisperX and Ollama servers. Treat the
configured URLs as the only places your meeting content travels, and review them
before processing sensitive recordings.
