// UI-free core of Distavo: config, state, transcript cleaning, validation, and
// the summarisation prompt — ported from the Python `meeting_pipeline` package
// and verified against it with parity tests (`swift test`). The macOS app links
// this package; AppKit/AVFoundation/SwiftUI stay in the app target.
